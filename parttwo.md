This  Digital Scholarship Summer Fellowship was conducted from May 30th to August 4th, 2017.  The six Digital Scholarship Fellows worked under the supervision of Laurie Allen and the mentorship of graduate student Leslie Jones to explore and bring to life a data set of monument ideas proposed by ordinary Philadelphia residents as part of the Mural Arts Monument Lab project. They were tasked with independently developing a suite of digital visualization tools, from creating a collective vision and purpose, to coding and implementation.

As part of their training and mentorship, we provided the fellows with a series of workshops designed to introduce them to the universe of digital tools at their disposal. These included web design using Jekyll, backend web design and project management using Reclaim web hosting, data hygiene in OpenRefine, and collaborative digital humanities coding using Jupyter Notebooks and Python. Additionally, Leslie held biweekly discussion sessions, in which students were guided to engage with the theoretical and practical implications of their work. To that end, fellows read and wrote responses to diverse texts including current news reports, peer-reviewed anthropology articles, and long-form journalism. Through these discussions, fellows engaged with important concepts like User Experience, Accessibility and Universal Design, digital longevity, and collaborative coding.
